# Chat-Room-with-Node.js

**Instructions for running the chat room-**

1.I am assuming you alread have node.js installed on your comp. If not go to [the node.js site](https://nodejs.org/en/download) and download it for your comp.

2.Also you should have npm installed.

3.Next, navigate to the directory where you have the code stored from the command line and type "npm install". It will install all the dependencies from package.json. 

4.Now, navigate to the Chat Room directory again and type "node server.js". This will start the http server.

5.Find the ip address of the comp on which the server is running. To do so -
  -type "ipconfig" in the command line(if you are running windows) or type "ifconfig" in the terminal window(if you are running    linux)

6.Once you've acquired the ip address, type "http://ipaddress:3000" where ipaddress is the ip adress of your device on which the server is running, in the url bar of your browser

7.You can do the same thing from a different device like your phone or tablet to access the server (Make sure the device and the   machine on which you are running the server are connected to the same network)

**And it's done! You now have a live chatroom on your WiFi or LAN.All devices connected to this network have acess to it**
